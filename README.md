# SuperHero Identity Quiz App

## Objective
Create an app that lets users find out which superhero or villain they resemble from either the Marvel or DC universe, based on their answers to a personality quiz.

## Features
- Personality quiz interface with a set of questions.
  - Minimum of 3 questions.
- Integration with the "SuperHero API" to fetch superhero data based on quiz results.
  - Determine a match from a subset of at least 3 SuperHeroes.
    - In other words, you don't need to be able to match with all the heroes or villains in the API. Pick at least 3, and make a quiz that matches the user to one of your selected SuperHeroes.
- Display detailed profiles of matched superheroes or villains.

## Additional Requirements
- Implementation of at least 1 transition or animation using one of the following libraries:
  - React Transition Group
  - Framer Motion
  - React Spring
  - GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
  - Styled Components (with Keyframes)
  - Material UI

## Suggestions
- Animated Selection of Answers
  - After the user selects an answer, animate their selection with an animation on the border or background of their selected answer.
- Animation of Question Cards
  - After the user finishes a question, animate the card that holds the question such that it moves off the screen to reveal the next question.
- These are just suggestions. You may make another animation or transition.
